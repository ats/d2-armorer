[ArmoreR is an analysis and loadout builder tool](https://deardestiny.shinyapps.io/armorer) for Destiny 2, built in R and Shiny.

Use ArmoreR to find optimal loadouts for specific stat combinations and desired exotic armor pieces, and then send the identified combination to DIM to apply mods and save as pre-built loadout.

There's no code in this repo, yet. I'm in the process of cleaning ArmoreR's code up to move from a private to public repository. Meanwhile, you can use the tool at https://deardestiny.shinyapps.io/armorer.
